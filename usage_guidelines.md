# ksonnet Branding Guidelines

These guidelines provide you with guidance for using the ksonnet logo. You can
use the logo on your website or in print without pre-approval, provided you
follow these basic guidelines.

You may display, modify, or use the ksonnet logo only in connection with
compliant implementations of ksonnet and related uses in the following ways. A
compliant implementation is an implementation of the unmodified ksonnet tool
chain version of Kubernetes found at https://github.com/ksonnet and compatible
branches thereof, together with published specifications, APIs and operational
patterns. Â Acceptable related uses include display, modification, or use of the
ksonnet logo in connection with your compliant implementation, your integration
with a compliant implementation, your support for a compliant implementation,
your Kubernetes-compatible product, or in collateral, presentations, and
marketing materials relating to compliant implementations of Kubernetes.

The ksonnet logo is copyright 2017 Heptio Inc.  All other usages should be
approved by Heptio with consultation of the ksonnet community.
